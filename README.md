This is a simple app designed to help record surf sessions.

The app is designed so that a user can simply enter a session at a designated location, along with a rating out of 5
stars, and track which conditions are favorable to their surf style. By default, the app will source weather and buoy data
from a series of sources and save this with the user's rating when a session is logged, helping the user better predict
which future conditions will result in future 5 star sessions.
